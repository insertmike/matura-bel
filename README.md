# MaturaBel - Mobile

Educational open source application to help students extend their knowledge in terms of Bulgarian literature as well as their grammatical knowledge. 

What problem does this app solves?

   Every year, hundred thousands of students in Bulgaria are giving enormous amount of money in Bulgaria for private lessons in order to prepare for the final evaluation test, which covers 5 years material. I find myself in similar situations while being in High School. Unfortunately not everyone can afford this. I believe that one free of charge mobile application, which is *cross-platform* can solve this problem.

## Development plan
The app will be divided into two main categories: *Literature* and *Grammatical*. The development process starts with the literature part, picking up all the required assets and then will be followed by the *Grammatical* part. 


### Literature Part 
The literature part consist of static information of all Bulgarian authors who are part of the mandatory final evaluation for all students graduating a High School Degree in Bulgaria.

   Consist of Authors cards in a  grid (*ListView*). Every card can be selected to go to the specic author.

   Every author has his own screen. In the beginning of the screen there is biographical information followed by another grid of items which are his compositions.
  - Composition screen
    This is screen consist of detailed information about the selected composition such as genre, main characters and main characteristic. In the future a sample essays can be added as this is also part of the final evaluation in Bulgaria.
